# Fort Team
### Fort Team is a real-time conversation project

## About
This project has the ambition to build a chat in real time using socket.io in javascript.

The appearance is related to several studies that I conducted where it resulted in a project with the following stacks:

The project organization is based on the MVC model.

**Vue.js**: Framework used in the view layer
**Node.js**: Used to build the other two layers, Controller and Model.

The data is stored in a **postgres** database and the entire cache is made by **redis**, in redis the database user Id is linked to the socket id.
